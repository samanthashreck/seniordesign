Project Title: 

Sound Sensing System with POE Technology


Project Summary:

Our application allows students to remotely check noise levels of a classroom and accurately find a quiet place to study or do work
This could take away the hassle of walking from room to room, going from building to building in search of a study space, especially during midterms or finals.

Tools and Languages I used:

NetBeans IDE, JavaScript, CSS, HTML5, JQuery, BootStrap, JSON, Python, Raspberry Pi 2


What's included on Github:

Web application, Final and Interim Reports, Poster Board 


My Responsibilities in the project:

- Created a web application that is easily accessible and students could use
	- Noise levels of the device relayed onto application
- Created a data storage program (written in Python using UDP protocols)
	- Taking readings from device and storing them into JSON file
	- Sending JSON readings to web application (using JQuery) 


Some things to Mentions:

This was a year long project from August 2016 to May 2016 at Lehigh University.
I worked with a partner, Zoe Protin. We are both computer engineers who recently graduated in May.


Future Works of our project:

Our system demonstrates the ability to easily collect and monitor noise levels in various buildings throughout a campus. To improve our project tremendously, it would need a better microphone and an expansion of our data collection analytics. To really take our project to the next level, a motion sensor would transform the data.
